# daylite

Daylite is the communications backbone for a number of processes running on the
next-generation Botball robot controller from KIPR. It's design was inspired by
ROS. Daylight, however, is simple to build, install, and use in comparison, with
no external dependencies or extra tooling required.

## Future work

In the future, Daylite will support automatically extending its node graph through network meshing.
This will allow robot controllers to seamlessly communicate.
